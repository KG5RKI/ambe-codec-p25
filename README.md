Notes

  - i've tested build/deploy scripts using android-ndk-r20-linux-x86_64, just set env ANDROID_NDK_HOME correctly
  - library method C++ references https://github.com/smarek/ambe-codec-p25/blob/master/main.h
  - ghidra extracted library typeinfo https://github.com/smarek/ambe-codec-p25/blob/master/lib/liblib-core.so.ghidra-auto-generated.h
  - seems like this should support both full-rate and half-rate variants of codec
